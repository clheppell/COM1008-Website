      <!--Main content-->
      <p>The Diamond Caf&eacute; is a good place to take a break from your studying or get a quick bite to eat in-between your lectures and labs. It is on the ground floor of the Diamond so it is a very convenient place to go whilst also being relatively affordable. Such as the £3.50 meal deal which includes a sandwich or panini, a snack, and a drink. The cooked hot food items are also reasonably cheap for the quality with nearly all of them being under £5.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/diamond_kitchen" target="_blank" title="@diamond_kitchen">Diamond Caf&eacute; is on Twitter</a> - Follow them for the latest special offers and new menu options.</p>
      <p>If you need something to get you going before tht morning lecture, get there before 10:30 on a weekday for the Croissant and any Hot Drink offer - for just &pound;2.35.</p>
      <p>The Caf&eacute; sells a wide variety of food including sandwiches, paninis, and burgers, but all with a worldwide focus and as a result, quirky flavour combinations. The Diamond  Caf&eacute; is typically open from 8AM till 5PM on weekdays and 9AM till 5PM on weekends.</p>
      <p>The seating area is relatively large with many small tables that could seat groups of approximately four. This could be a good place to have a relaxed planning session or to discuss ideas for your group projects or to help each other out if you are stuck on some lecture content or some questions on an exercise sheet.</p>
      <p>Make sure you grab yourself a <a href="http://withus.com/hustleandbustle/genius-card/" target="_blank" title="GeniUS card by withUS">GeniUS card</a> so that you can collect points at any of the University's food outlets, or have your parents top up your account from home.</p>
