    <h1>Accessibility</h1>
    <p>Accessibility is a key consieration with website design, and this website has been designed to be as accessible as possible.</p>
    <p>We have ensured through by making considered choices with regards to CSS such as using the <code>rem</code> unit for font sizing, which means that we use the user's default font size instead of forcing our own and in HTML we have followed the correct semantic structuring to make each page as clear of possible to screen readers.</p>
    <p>Where necessary, text visible only to screen readers (using CSS3 media queries) will allow meaning to be conveyed to blind and partially sighted users if it is not possible to do so directly on specific elements. Similarly, irrelevant elements (such as icons) will be hidden from screen readers if they are accompanied by text anyway.</p>
    <p>All images are given <code>alt=”description”</code> tags as appropriate so that the blind and partially sighted can make sense of them.</p>
