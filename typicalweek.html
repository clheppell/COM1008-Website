      <h1>A typical week for <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> Students in the Diamond</h1>
      <p>A typical week for a computer science student will consist of a mix between various lectures and labs with the occasional quiz to help you to see the progress you are making and to see if you are on track for the grades that you want.</p>
      <p>Below is an example timetable for what a week could look like for a first year computer science student:</p>

      <p>As well as your lectures and labs you will be given assignments and readings that you must do but these can be done at any time you wish. For many students who join a sports club Wednesday afternoons will be the time that matches or training will take place which is why generally there will be no lectures or labs that take place at this time.</p>
      <p>The weekend is when you will have some time to catch up on things you did not get to finish in the week and to rest so that you are fully prepared for the next week. You may want to use this time to re-watch lectures that you found particularly difficult, write up your notes in a neater or different way, or do work on assignments.</p>
      <p>Sometimes there are extra activities that are run by the computer science society or hack society that you may wish to take part in over the weekend such as a hackathon with the hack society - either one run in the university or one that you travel to at a different university (travel for some of these is reimbursed by the society!). There are also gamejams and tutorial sessions that are run by the computer science society. These can all be a great way for you to gain valuable skills that will be useful for your degree and beyond.</p>
